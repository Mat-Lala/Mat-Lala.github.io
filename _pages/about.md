## About me
My name is Matthieu Lassartesses. I'm an experienced **Business Intelligence consultant** specialized in SAP Solutions, and I'm embarking on an exciting transition to the world of data analysis and, eventually, data engineering. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects, spanning diverse industries from finance to the public sector and automotive. As a consultant, I've played a pivotal role in setting up robust reporting solutions for renowned companies across Europe, working with esteemed organizations like **Deloitte Consulting** and **Valeo**. This journey has not only sharpened my technical acumen but also honed my expertise in optimizing data management, integration, and reporting within complex enterprise systems.

In addition to my extensive computer-related experience, I bring a unique dimension to the table. I hold a special certification as a Physical Therapist in both France and Germany. My dual role as a healthcare practitioner and a consultant has equipped me with a valuable set of attributes, including effective communication, empathy, and adaptability, which prove instrumental in both my healthcare practice and my work in the tech world. 

With a solid foundation in business intelligence, I'm enthusiastic about exploring the intricacies of data analysis and, down the road, delving into the world of data engineering.

## What I am working on
Currently, I'm in the final stages of completing the **DataCamp Data Analyst Career Track**, which has provided me with in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in **SQL, Python, Tableau**, and data analysis techniques. This journey has equipped me with the skills necessary to make data-driven decisions, extract valuable insights from complex datasets, and present them effectively.

Simultaneously, I'm dedicated to building my **Data Analyst Portfolio**, showcasing real-world projects and analyses that highlight my technical skills. These projects not only serve as a testament to my skills but also reflect my passion for transforming raw data into meaningful solutions.

In a data-driven world, the ability to harness the power of cloud computing is a valuable asset, and I'm excited to embark on this learning journey.
