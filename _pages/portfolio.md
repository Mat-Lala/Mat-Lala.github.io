From the roaring twenties to the modern-day, American baby name tastes have undergone quite the transformation. We're about to embark on a journey through a century of baby names, where we'll explore what's in vogue, what's timeless, and what's oh-so-2010s.

Our dataset, provided by the United States Social Security Administration, is like a treasure trove of names given to over 5,000 American babies each year from 1920 to 2020. We'll be diving into the data to uncover the ebb and flow of baby name trends, find the names that have stood the test of time for over a century, and compare them to the new kids on the block.

Get ready to decode the name game and discover not just what's popular but also how trends in names have evolved over the years. Whether you're a parent-to-be or a data enthusiast, understanding these trends is not only fun but also a valuable skill. Let's name it and claim it! 👶📈🧐😄
